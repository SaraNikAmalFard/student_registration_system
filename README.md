# student_registration_system

Welcome to this project. HHere I have shared with you the source code of a student registration system implemented in C++ .
This project is implemented based on Object Oriented principles. 
The database used for this project is a text file , so the project contains reading and writing from files. 
To compile and run the project you need to use g++ , or any other IDE that supports C++ compilation such as VS-Code.
There exists 2 hierarchy in this project , general Student class , and three subclasses  , BSc students , MSc students and PhD students. All these students have some common functionalities which is implemented in the parent class , and have some different manners.
All processes such as enrolment in modules , all searches and etc. is done in a separate class called StudentRegistration. Som functionalities of the system are as follows:

*Student Enrolment
*Removing a student
*Showing all students
*Finding a student by his/her ID
*Finding students by their mode of study (type)
*Finding all students who have enrolled for the same module
