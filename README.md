Welcome to this project. HHere I have shared with you the source code of a student registration system implemented in C++ .<br/>
This project is implemented based on Object Oriented principles. <br/>
The database used for this project is a text file , so the project contains reading and writing from files.<br/> 
To compile and run the project you need to use g++ , or any other IDE that supports C++ compilation such as VS-Code.<br/>
There exists 2 hierarchy in this project , general Student class , and three subclasses  , BSc students , MSc students and PhD students. All these students have some common functionalities which is implemented in the parent class , and have some different manners.<br/>
All processes such as enrolment in modules , all searches and etc. is done in a separate class called StudentRegistration. Som functionalities of the system are as follows:<br/>

*Student Enrolment<br/>
*Removing a student<br/>
*Showing all students<br/>
